## Checkpoint 2750

Completed. 
- Used create-react-app to initialize the boilerplate. 
- Created a Components folder with the <ToDoItem /> component. 
- <ToDoItem /> is successfully rendering on screen.

## Checkpoint 2751
Completed. 
- Added constructor/super and defined initial state. 
- Isolated items in the todoArray with .map() so that many arrays could be shown via one <ToDoItem /> line.
- Added props to that single <ToDoItem /> line to connect to the data from the initial state.
- In <ToDoItem /> component, created a checkbox. Hooked the checkbox and the hard-coded text to isCompleted and description, so that the data in the initial state is now showing.
